An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing sales performance across customer categories, provinces, and time periods — enabling management and marketing teams to make data-driven decisions.

Overview

This Power BI report provides a comprehensive view of sales performance, designed for the management and marketing departments.
It allows users to monitor key metrics such as total sales, quantity sold, year-over-year growth, and category performance across different provinces and time periods.

Business Objective

Key Insights

Novelty Shops generated the highest total sales ($36M) among all categories.

Monthly sales exhibited a consistent upward trend throughout the year, with notable peaks in June and November.

Total sales reached $50M with an average YoY growth of 9.2%.
